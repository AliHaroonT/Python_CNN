# A Convolution Neural Network (CNN) From Scratch
This was written using basic python to deeply understand the forward and backward propagation of a neural network.

## Usage

Install dependencies:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run it with no arguments:

```bash
$ python cnn.py
$ python cnn_torch.py
```

You can also [run this code in your browser](https://repl.it/@vzhou842/A-CNN-from-scratch-Part-2).
